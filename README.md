This repository contains a curated selection of exercises I‚Äôve completed while studying Java. Each one was carefully chosen based on its topic, relevance, and learning value ‚Äî with a focus on clarity, logic, and practical understanding. 

All the code is written in 100% pure Java, intended for hands-on training and foundational learning.

Additionally, every exercise is well-commented, as commenting is an essential part of my personal study technique to better understand and retain concepts.

*As James Gosling, the creator of Java, once said, ‚ÄúThe magic of Java is in the community ‚Äî sharing knowledge and collaborating to build better software together.‚Äù I hope this repository can be a small contribution to the vibrant Java programming community.*
